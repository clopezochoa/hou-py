## Installation

In order to be able to import custom python modules in houdini you should make a few checks:

1. Python scripts are stored in a path like this. If the scripts folder or the python folder don't exist, create them.
```
  C:\Users\'your_user_name'\Documents\houdini'your_houdini_version'\scripts\python
```
2. There must be a **PYTHONPATH** variable holding that path in the User Environment Variables dialog.
